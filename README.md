# The Hangry Elf

## Project: Code Institute December 2021 Hackathon: Happy Holidays

## Introduction

This website is the project for Code Institutes' December 2021 Hackathon created by John Traas, Claudia Lai, Marialena Livathinopoulou, David Paul Thompson and Adam Boley, collectively the team called The Newbies, since this is the first hackathon project undertaken by each member. 

The website is named The Hangry Elf, and is a combination advent calendar and recipe site. Each day of December is represented by a card item. When the card is clicked, it expands and displays a simple recipe for that day. An effort was made to source recipes from different countries and cultures, for the purposes of diversity, since the hackathon theme is not specifically Christmas, but the December holidays generally. Of particular note are the dishes traditionally made and eaten by Jews during Hannukah, since Hannukah 2021 falls partly in December. 

The recipes are held in a linked database. When a user creates an account, the recipes held behind each card are randomly generated from this database. As each day elapses, the recipe for that day unlocks. 

The theme of The Hangry Elf is that Santa's most important Elf, Jimmy, is prone to getting hangry (possessed of a famous temper when his belly starts rumbling...). 
To avoid this, Santa must ensure that Jimmy is fed a delicious dish every day so that all of the presents will be made in time, and that the sleigh is ready to go!

## Design

## Wireframes

The Wireframe.cc site was used to plan out the basic design and look of the project. We found it useful because David, the designated wireframe designer for the project, could share his screen during Slack calls and each call participant could draw on the wireframe to outline their ideas. The wireframe images are located in the wireframes folder in the .assets folder

The wireframes are below:

## Features

## Technologies

The Hangry Elf was primarily created using the HTML, CSS and Python programming languages. Python was used because several of the team preferred Python over JavaScript. 
Platforms used:
- Github: Github was used to store the project files, and to allow each team member to be added as a contributor to the project. The Projects tab of the repository was used to note down initial ideas for the project, assign tasks and track progress.
- Gitpod: The Gitpod IDE was used to create and edit the project files, and could convientially be accessed directly from Github
- Bootstrap 5.0: Bootstrap was used to provide the initial project template
- Django: Django was used as the technology framework, and provided the template for allowing the user to login to the site
- Heroku: Heroku was used to deploy the project
- Slack: Slack was used to coordinate the actions of the team, discuss ideas and share links. 
- Google Docs: The team created and shared a Google Doc to note down ideas and store recipe links
